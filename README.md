# MCM &mdash; Minimal Configuration Manager

<b>Minimal Configuration Manager (mcm)</b> is a suite of tools to provide configuration management, like Puppet or Chef.
However, mcm differs in that it tries to embody the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), in particular: <q>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".</q>
mcm operates on a data format for describing a catalog of resources, with tools for both producing and consuming this data format.
