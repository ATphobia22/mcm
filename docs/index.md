# mcm &mdash; Minimal Configuration Manager

<b>Minimal Configuration Manager (mcm)</b> is a suite of tools to provide configuration management, like Puppet or Chef.
However, mcm differs in that it tries to embody the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), in particular: "Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new 'features'."
mcm operates on a data format for describing a catalog of resources, with tools for both producing and consuming this data format.
See the blog post [Why mcm?]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-12-14-why-mcm %}) for more background.
